# Advent2021
A python program that zooms into part of the Mandelbrot set each day, generating a beautiful image.

[Advent_2021.py](https://github.com/EthanTribe/Advent2021/blob/main/Advent%202021.py) is adapted from [Mandelbrot.py](https://github.com/EthanTribe/The_Mandelbrot_Set_and_Pi/blob/main/Mandelbrot.py) and zooms in to the focal point -0.743643887037158704752191506114774 + 0.131825904205311970493132056385139i by a factor of 10 each day. An HD image is generated with a random predefined colourmap.
[Advent_2021_precise.py](https://github.com/EthanTribe/Advent2021/blob/main/Advent%202021%precise.py) is needed due to the low default precision of Python floats, otherwise past day __ the image's resolution will rapidly decrease.
In parenthesis after images are the maximum number of iterations (`imax`) before a pixel is counted as being in the Mandelbrot set, which effects the clarity, colour distribution, and runtime of the program.
